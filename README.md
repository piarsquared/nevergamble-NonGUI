# Never Gamble (Terminal Edition)

**Never Gamble** is a minimalist stock simulation game that runs entirely in your terminal.  
No GUI. No distractions. Just raw Python logic and dangerously poor financial decisions.

This version is a text-based prototype inspired by 2003devin's Geometry Dash level _"Never Gamble"_  
(he makes some weird stuff, by the way, so just... be careful looking that up).

---

## Features (Current Version)

- Terminal UI with a basic page management system
- Command system (`help`, `clear`, `save`, `quit`, etc.) â€” basic but solid
- Save file support! So you can continue your gambling addiction later.
- Built to expand into full stock logic and ASCII graphs (eventually)
- In the future, I do intend to make a GUI version of this if you REALLY hate using the terminal.

> [!TIP]
> This is a **work in progress**. Expect some spaghetti code and placeholder features for now.

|---------|-------------|

| `save`  | (Placeholder for now) Saves your progress |

More commands (like `balance`, `gamble`, `invest`, and `graph`) coming soon.
